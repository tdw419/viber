# Feature Specification: GUI Enhancements

## 1. Overview

The current LanceDB GUI is a functional but monolithic application. This project will refactor the UI into a more modular and extensible architecture. This will enable easier maintenance, faster development of new features, and a more intuitive user experience.

## 2. Key Goals

*   **Modularity**: Decompose the main window into smaller, reusable widgets.
*   **Extensibility**: Create a flexible architecture that allows for the easy addition of new features.
*   **Maintainability**: Improve code organization and readability.
*   **Improved UX**: Lay the groundwork for a more modern and user-friendly interface.

## 3. Non-Goals

*   This phase will not introduce major new features. The focus is on refactoring the existing UI.
*   This phase will not involve significant changes to the backend or database logic.
