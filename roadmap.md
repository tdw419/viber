# Unfinished Roadmap

This file contains a list of ideas for future development. When the `iteration_agent.py` has no other tasks to perform, it will pick an idea from this list and begin the development cycle for it.

## Ideas

- [x] Implement a more robust `scale_agents` function that can scale down as well as up. (In Progress)
- [x] Implement a more robust `assign_tasks` function that uses the `update` method correctly. (In Progress)
- [ ] Implement a GUI for the "Dynamic Agent Creation" feature.
- [ ] Implement a system for agents to learn from their mistakes and improve their performance over time.
- [ ] Implement a system for agents to communicate with each other and collaborate on tasks.
